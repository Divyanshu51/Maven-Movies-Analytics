- Performed **data cleaning, joining, and merging** using Pandas
- Removed redundant or unused columns and handled null values
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover:
  - Most rented categories and films
  - Top revenue-generating films
  - Rental trends by customer
- Created insightful **visualisations** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas)

- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL Workbench
  

## 📊 Key Insights
